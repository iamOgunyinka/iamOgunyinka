## Howdy stranger ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹

My name is Joshua Ogunyinka. I am a Software Engineer at Igara Studio, working on this wonderful software called [Aseprite](https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite), among [others](https://github.com/aseprite/).

I develop state of the art software that runs on almost all platforms. Most of my cool projects are proprietary (and are thus in private repositories), that's why I have series of commit logs and almost empty repositories shown. ðŸ˜„

Fun facts

- ðŸ‘¯ I wake up everyday, happy that I am contributing meaningfully to something.

- ðŸ’¬ I value life and I love learning but I keep opinion on everything to myself.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I don't do anything for fun.
