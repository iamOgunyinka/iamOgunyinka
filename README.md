## Howdy stranger ðŸ˜„ ðŸ‘‹

My name is Joshua Ogunyinka. I am a Software Engineer and my day-to-day work involves heavy use of C++(mostly) and Python(sometimes).

I develop state of the art software that runs on almost all platforms. Most of my cool projects are proprietary(and are thus in private repositories), that's why I have series of commit logs and almost empty repositories shown. ðŸ˜„

Here are some of the things I have worked on recently

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™ve worked on *woody*: a custom web server for my company that implements various web protocols(HTTP, SOCK4, SOCK5) for some services we run privately.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning golang as a third language because I hear it's cool.

- ðŸ‘¯ I wake up everyday, happy that I am contributing meaningfully to something.

- ðŸ’¬ I value life and I love learning but I keep opinion on everything to myself.

- ðŸ’¬ Sitting on either side of the table doing interviews makes me "uncomfortably" nervous.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I don't do anything for fun.
