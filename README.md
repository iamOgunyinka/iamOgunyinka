## Howdy stranger ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹

My name is Joshua Ogunyinka. I am a (C/C++/Python/Go) Software Engineer and I develop state of the art software that runs on almost all platforms. Most of my cool projects are proprietary (and are thus in private repositories), that's why I have series of commit logs and histories with almost empty repositories shown in my profile.

Fun facts

- ðŸ‘¯ I wake up everyday, happy that I am contributing meaningfully to something.

- ðŸ’¬ I value life and I love learning but I keep opinion on everything to myself.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I don't do anything for fun.
