## Hi stranger ðŸ˜„ ðŸ‘‹

My name is Joshua Ogunyinka. I am a Software Engineer and well versed in C++(primary) and Python.

I develop state of the art software that runs on almost all platforms. Most of my super-cool projects are proprietary(and are thus in private repositories), that's why I have series of commit logs and almost empty repositories shown ðŸ˜„

Here are some of the things I have worked on recently

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on *woody*: a custom web server for my company that implements various web protocols(HTTP, SOCK4, SOCK5) for some services we run privately.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning golang as a third language because I hear it's cool.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that will change the way the world works, in a positive way.


- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about C++, I'll try to tell you all the cools things it can/cannot do, to the best of my knowledge

- ðŸ“« Mobile: plus nine seven one, five two, four seven zero, eight six one zero

- âš¡ Fun fact: I don't do anything for fun.
